## About me 

 I’ve been working as a doctor in a children's hospital for 11 years. My duties included diagnosis and medical inspection. I have finished front-end development courses in IT Academy this year. Becoming a front-end developer is my dream. It’s very interesting to create something new and see the result of your work. I like to improve my knowledge in front-end development every day.
